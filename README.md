Two different players were implemented for the Fives-and-Threes Dominos game,  
followed by testing and evaluating the performance of these players through simulated matches.
- Grade Achieved for Code: 35/40(87.5%)
- Grade Achieved for Report: 50/60(83.3%)

### Design
- The project utilises a top-down design approach for all functions and player strategies
- The design is illustrated with diagrams and detailed descriptions in the [Design report](https://github.com/jihyebaee/Haskell-Project/blob/main/JihyeBae_Design.pdf)

### Testing
- Comprehensive testing was conducted using a bottom-up approach, covering all edge cases
- Players were tested against each other to ensure accuracy
- Detailed test sets and results are documented in the [Testing report](https://github.com/jihyebaee/Haskell-Project/blob/main/JihyeBae_Testing.pdf)
